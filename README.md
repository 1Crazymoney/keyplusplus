Other programming languages, they don't want you to win. That's why we're bringing you :key:++, the key to more success.

## Hello World
```
🔥 "Hello World"
```


## Fizz My Buzz

```
they don't want you to fizzbuzz max
  
  🔑 n 0
  
  ride wit me
    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
      🔥 "FizzBuzz"
    elif n % 3 == 0:
      🔥 "Fizz"
    elif n % 5 == 0:
      🔥 "Buzz"
    else:
      🔥 n

    if n >= max:
      you played yourself
    
    another one

  major 🔑 👍

🙏
```

## How to run
```
$> python 🔑++ examples/hello_world.liooooon
```

## Name
This language is called :key:++ because it's the key to more success, and another one.

## Syntax


#### Boilerplate
All :key:++ programs must begin with the following two-line comment:

```
#DJKHALED
#WETHEBEST
```


#### Built-in types
:key:++ naturally supports integers, floats, and strings. Booleans are `👍`, true, and `👎`, false. 

:key:++ accepts all standard operators, `+`, `-`, `*`, `\`, `%`, `**`, etc. Anything you could find in Python ;)

```
1
3.14
👍
"another one"
```

#### Printing
To print a value, simply prefix it with `🔥`.

```
🔥 3.14
🔥 "another one"
```


#### Assigning variables
:key:++ uses the following notation for assigning variable values:

```
🔑 x 1
```

You can read this as "The key to x is 1". The right term can include operators, so `🔑 x x + 1` will assign the value `x + 1` to `x`. 

#### Functions
Function definitions begin with `they don't want you to [name] [args]` and are closed with `🙏`. To specify the return value, use `major 🔑 [optional value]`. :key:++ does not yet support anonymous functions.

An example implementation of Fibonacci is below:

```
they don't want you to fibonacci n
  
  🔑 acc1 0
  🔑 acc2 1

  ride wit me
    🔑 temp acc2
    🔑 acc2 acc2 + acc1
    🔑 acc1 temp
    🔑 n n - 1

    if n < 1: 
      you played yourself
  another one

  major 🔑 acc1 
🙏
```


#### Loops
Don't play yourself. :key:++ makes it easy to write code and easy to call `another one`. All :key:++ loops are initialized with the tag `ride wit me` and default behavior is always `another one`.

```
ride wit me
  ...
another one
```

#### Breaks
To exit a loop use the command `you played yourself`. Thus we can write a traditional loop as follows:

```
ride wit me
	[...]
	if [condition]:
		you played yourself
another one
```

#### Importing modules

## Next Steps

We're currently working on implementing struct support in :key:++. 

We are also working on O'Khaled, a JIT compiler for 🔑++.
